These are sample scripts for using libcloud. Note they make contain RimuHosting specifics.

Please DO NOT make API Keys public :)

To use this, first install libcloud. (Note the rimuhosting fork may have a few patches in it not in the offical libcloud)

git clone  git://github.com/rimuhosting/libcloud.git
cd libcloud
sudo python install
Once libcloud is installed, get the script repository, and run the scripts.

git clone git://github.com/rimuhosting/rimuhosting-libcloud-simple.git
cd rimuhosting-libcloud-simple
python list_images.py <apikey>
